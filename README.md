# TNEBot

This was a bot I started on back in 2014 for a nintendo forum I was a part of.
Last update was: February 2nd, 2015.

It was ran periodically to read the forums RSS feed and check for new entries
and post them on a Twitter account. Posted entries where then cached in a
SQLite 3 database to prevent double-posting.

The idea was to eventually expand the bot to also post to facebook and reddit.
Never got around to that thoughâ€¦
